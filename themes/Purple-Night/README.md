# Pale-Night

A very simple [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme without the bloat. Built with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com). I will add features as I feel necessary in my own use. The theme is under MIT license, so feel free to fork and modify it to your own desire.

# Installation

# Logo and Footer

Unfortunately, there is no way to add logo setting to config.yml, instead you should modify it directly in partials (logo.html).

Footer links can be added through settings (config.yml).

# Color Palette

Colors are taken from [Rose Pine Theme](https://rosepinetheme.com).
